# Potential Capstone Project Ideas

## 1. 2D Version of 'Raft' (Potential/Initial Project Idea)
This project involves creating a 2D survival game inspired by the popular game *Raft*. Players must gather resources, craft items, and build a floating platform while surviving against the elements and various threats. The game will focus on core mechanics such as resource management, construction, and exploration, but with a 2D perspective instead of the original's 3D view. The player will have to navigate the ocean, manage their raft, and fend off dangers like sharks while maintaining their health, hunger, and thirst.

## 2. Turn-based DSA-Inspired Game
This capstone project is focused on creating a turn-based strategy game inspired by Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Players will engage in tactical battles where they control units with different abilities, each utilizing key data structure concepts like stacks, queues, and trees. The game could feature a grid-based battlefield where players must plan their moves using algorithmic strategies to defeat enemies, with increasing difficulty as the game progresses.

## 3. Soul-knight-Inspired AI-Driven Game
This project draws inspiration from *Soul Knight*, a fast-paced dungeon crawler game. The goal is to create a similar experience where players battle through procedurally generated dungeons with an array of weapons and power-ups. The unique aspect of this game is its AI-driven mechanics, where non-player characters (NPCs) and enemies are driven by intelligent behavior patterns that adapt based on the player's actions. The project will focus on AI development to create challenging and dynamic gameplay.

## 4. R.E.P.O. x Overcooked Game
This project is a hybrid concept combining elements of *R.E.P.O.*, a resource management game, with the chaotic, fast-paced gameplay of *Overcooked*. Players will manage a team in a frantic environment, collecting and delivering resources while handling time-sensitive tasks. The game will have multiple levels of increasing difficulty, with teamwork, resource allocation, and multitasking being key to success. It will challenge players to think on their feet and collaborate under pressure.
